            <p>Baking notes:</p>
            <li>Weights and measurements are provided in both metric and imperial units as well as baking measurements such as cups or teaspoons. For those who are new to baking, tsp = teaspoons and tbsp = tablespoon.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When measuring ingredients, a scale is the most accurate but measuring equipment can be used instead. Always level out ingredients to the top of the measuring equipment.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Temperature fluctuates in an oven during baking and each oven varies. Some ovens cook unevenly so make adjustments such as rotating the dish during baking to achieve even browning.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Eggs should be brought up to room temperature before being used, unless stated. The eggs used in the recipes are assumed to be large (55g, 2oz) eggs so make adjustments accordingly.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Unsalted butter should always be used, unless stated. This is because salt can be added according to taste but also because salted butter contains annatto which is a yellow food colouring. It also has a higher water content than unsalted butter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Butter should be softened to room temperature when making cakes. This can be done by leaving the butter out to warm to room temperature and the softness allows it to cream well with sugar.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Butter should be chilled when making pastries. This allows for it to be rubbed into the flour to make a crumbly mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>As a rule of thumb, if chocolate is the main part of the dish, a higher cocoa content chocolate is a good choice. This is because it has a lower sugar content which makes the flavour more chocolately and less sugary.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once you get more familiar with the recipes, you can even substitute in different ingredients. For example, you could substitute out regular milk for soy milk if you have allergies. A portion of flour can be substituted with cocoa powder for a chocolate flavour, and so on. Experiment around to see what works for you!</li>
